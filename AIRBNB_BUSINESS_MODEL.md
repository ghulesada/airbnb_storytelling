People with an empty room can earn money by renting their space

The host service fee for homes is generally 3%. the gues service fee for homes ranges between 0% and 20% of the booking subtotal.

The people who cant afford hotel, they can go for airbnb.

the guest can use AC, WIFI and other homely feature of host. For the same features they would have to pay more in hotels
